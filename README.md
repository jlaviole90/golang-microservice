A simple HTTP server and microservice-ready template written in Go. Pretty low in dependencies, and the ones that are used could be replaced or removed fairly easily. Docker ready, and with docker compose it can host a local persistent postgres database.

Not perfect by any means, but super easy to fanagle into whatever you need it to be and "just about" production ready for whatever use case that is.
